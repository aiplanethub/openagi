# 🛠️ Tools

## What is Tool?

Tool is a functionality based on which the data is fetched to the Agent for further analysis and decision making. A wide array of tools is cataloged in the tools database, designed to support activities such as internet searches, email dispatch, interactions with Git repositories, and much more. Users have the flexibility to create their own tools and seamlessly integrate them into the framework's operations.

> Note: Some of the tools are not pre-installed with the OpenAGI library. If you encounter an `OpenAGIException` due to an Import Error, you'll need to manually install the required package to use the tool.

## Tool configuration

### 1. DuckDuckGoSearch Tool

The DuckDuckGoSearch tool is a tool that can be used to search for words, documents, images, videos, news, maps and text translation using the DuckDuckGo.com search engine. DuckDuckGo Search is a web search engine that _DuckDuckGo_ is an independent Google alternative that lets you search and browse the web, but it emphasises protecting user privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalised search results.

```python
from openagi.actions.tools.ddg_search import DuckDuckGoSearch

### How to build a custom Tool?

In OpenAGI, building a custom tool is straightforward by wrapping your custom logic inside a class that inherits from `BaseAction` and implementing the `execute` method. This setup allows you to encapsulate the necessary configurations and operations within the custom tool, making it easy to integrate and use within the OpenAGI framework.

#### Syntax

1. **Import Necessary Modules:**
   * Begin by importing the necessary modules from `pydantic` and `openagi`. `Field` is used to define parameters, and `BaseAction` is the base class for creating custom actions in OpenAGI.
2. **Define the Custom Tool Class:**
   * Create a class `CustomToolName` that inherits from `BaseAction`. This class represents your custom tool.
   * Within the class, define a variable `vars` using `Field()` from `pydantic`. This variable will hold any parameters required by your tool. Replace `dtype` with the actual data type of the parameter (e.g., `str`, `int`, `List[str]`).
3. **Implement the `execute` Method:**
   * The `execute` method is where the core logic of your tool will be implemented. This method will be called when the tool is executed.
   * Inside the `execute` method, write the code necessary, this might include loading data, processing it, and returning the desired output.
   * Make sure the execute function returns `str` data.&#x20;

```python
from pydantic import Field
from openagi.actions.base import BaseAction

class CustomToolName(BaseAction):
    """
    docstring for the tool is must
    """
    vars: dtype = Field() #define the required parameters for your tool. 
    
    def execute(self):
        # tool integration code
        return "str data"
```

#### **Example**

In this custom tool integration example, we will implement the Unstructured IO data loading tool. This custom tool provides the flexibility to act as a wrapper for Unstructured IO as an action tool in OpenAGI.&#x20;

The `execute` function is where the magic happens; if any variables or parameters need to be defined, they should be declared within the Custom Tool class. This setup ensures that all necessary configurations and parameters are encapsulated within the tool, allowing for seamless and efficient data loading and processing.

```python
from pydantic import Field
from openagi.actions.base import BaseAction

from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf
from unstructured.chunking.title import chunk_by_title


class UnstructuredPdfLoaderAction(BaseAction):
    """
    Use this Action to extract content from PDFs including metadata.
    Returns a list of dictionary with keys 'type', 'element_id', 'text', 'metadata'.
    """
    file_path: str = Field(
        default_factory=str,
        description="File or pdf file url from which content is extracted.",
    )

    def execute(self):        
        elements = partition_pdf(self.file_path, extract_images_in_pdf=True)
        chunks = chunk_by_title(elements)

        dict_elements = []
        for element in chunks:
            dict_elements.append(element.to_dict())

        with open("ele.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(str(dict_elements))

        return str(dict_elements)
```
