  This example shows how to create an OpenAGI agent with three workers (Research
  Analyst, Tech Content Strategist, Review and Editing Specialist) to
  autonomously research, write, and review a blog post.

# Blog Writing Agent

**Import the Required Modules**

Import the necessary modules for setting up the agent, including tools for internet searches, content writing, and memory management.

```python
from openagi.actions.files import WriteFileAction
from openagi.actions.tools.ddg_search import DuckDuckGoNewsSearch
from openagi.actions.tools.webloader import WebBaseContextTool
from openagi.agent import Admin
from openagi.llms.azure import AzureChatOpenAIModel
from openagi.memory import Memory
from openagi.planner.task_decomposer import TaskPlanner
from openagi.worker import Worker
from rich.console import Console
from rich.markdown import Markdown
```

**Set Up the LLM (Large Language Model)**

Load the configuration for the AzureChatOpenAIModel from environment variables.

```python
os.environ["AZURE_BASE_URL"]="https://<replace-with-your-endpoint>.openai.azure.com/"
os.environ["AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"] = "<replace-with-your-deployment-name>"
os.environ["AZURE_MODEL_NAME"]="gpt4-32k"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"]="2023-05-15"
os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"]=  "<replace-with-your-key>"
â€‹
config = AzureChatOpenAIModel.load_from_env_config()
llm = AzureChatOpenAIModel(config=config)
```

**Define the Team Members**

Create worker agents with specific roles and instructions. Each worker is equipped with tools to perform their designated tasks.

1. **Research Analyst:** Conducts research on the latest developments in AI.
2. **Tech Content Strategist:** Writes the blog post based on the research.
3. **Review and Editing Specialist:** Reviews and edits the blog post, ensuring clarity and grammatical accuracy.

```python
researcher = Worker(
    role="Research Analyst",
    instructions="Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI and data science. You work at a leading tech think tank. Your expertise lies in identifying emerging trends. You have a knack for dissecting complex data and presenting actionable insights.",
    actions=[
        DuckDuckGoNewsSearch,
        WebBaseContextTool,
    ],
)
writer = Worker(
    role="Tech Content Strategist",
    instructions="Craft compelling content on tech advancements. You are a renowned Content Strategist, known for your insightful and engaging articles. You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives. Finally return the entire article as output.",
    actions=[
        DuckDuckGoNewsSearch,
        WebBaseContextTool,
    ],
)
reviewer = Worker(
    role="Review and Editing Specialist",
    instructions="Review the content for clarity, engagement, grammatical accuracy, and alignment with company values and refine it to ensure perfection. A meticulous editor with an eye for detail, ensuring every piece of content is clear, engaging, and grammatically perfect. Finally write the blog post to a file and return the same as output.",
    actions=[
        DuckDuckGoNewsSearch,
        WebBaseContextTool,
        WriteFileAction,
    ],
)
```

**Set Up the Admin**

Configure the Admin to manage and coordinate the tasks. The Admin assigns tasks to the workers and oversees the entire workflow.

```python
admin = Admin(
    planner=TaskPlanner(human_intervene=False),
    memory=Memory(),
    llm=llm,
)
admin.assign_workers([researcher, writer, reviewer])
```

**Run the Task**

The Admin executes the task by providing a query and description. The task involves researching, writing, and reviewing a blog post about the future of AI.

```python
res = admin.run(
   query="Write a blog post about future of AI. Feel free to write files to maintain the context.",
   description="Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in AI in 2024. Identify key trends, breakthrough technologies, and potential industry impacts. Using the insights provided, develop an engaging blog post that highlights the most significant AI advancements. Your post should be informative yet accessible, catering to a tech-savvy audience. Make it sound cool, avoid complex words so it doesn't sound like AI.",
)
```

**Print the Results**

Finally, print the results from the OpenAGI, displaying the content generated by the agent.

```python
print(res)
```

#### Output

The agent will create a file with the following content:
